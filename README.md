- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PantheraDigital

Currently I attend school online at SNHU which provides me the ability to work on schoolwork on my own time. This allows me to use my free time to have fun and use my coding skills. 

I share my projects here on my GitHub and on my [website](https://panthera-digital.online/). I also share neet tricks I learn about Unity and C# on my website. Dont let my contributions here fool you though. I code daily. I just use github for backups and holding code examples.  

I began coding in 2017 when I first went to college and started on C++ getting the fundamentals of code, syntax, data structures and algorithms, all that stuff. Later I had to switch to online school where I pursue my computer science degree now. I got into this world back in highschool though when I got into a game design class where we learned a little about scripting, Source engine, and Unreal Engine 4. I personally found Unreal engine fun to use so I learned its blueprints system while trying to make projects until roughly when I switched schools where I changed over to Unity and using C# more. Now I make my projects there and try to share them as much as I can.
