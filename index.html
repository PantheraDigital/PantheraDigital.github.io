                        This project was a game idea I had and decided to build a demo of using my past projects in Unity as a base. 
                        All the art is composed of assets I have found on Itch.io while all the code is my own.<br><br>
                        I am using the character controller I developed but have added on to it to allow for the use of Unity&#39s newer 
                        input system which allows for easier multiplayer and device support. This has also proven to be this project's biggest 
                        challenge so far due to having to learn the new system and find how to make it compatible with the controller systems I had already made.

                        Demo was simply made to demo the 2D entity controller I had just made but I decided to expand it some to make it more of a game and enjoyable rather than a shallow demo.<br>
                        I designed and made 3 levels based around 3 different asset packs I had found on Itch.io. 
                        To add to the game I included spikes as a hazard as well as platforms that move, blocks that break under the player&#39s feet, 
                        buttons that had to be hit to trigger platforms, and even coins as a score mechanic.<br><br>
                        I found difficulty in designing levels so I ultimately decided to stop at 3 levels and decided platforming games were not something I am good at designing.

                        I created this project to boost my familiarity with C# while I was unable to work on my Entity Controller pack. 
                        The idea is based on an assignment I had in school where we worked with a tile based game very similar to this as a way to learn object oriented programming using C++.<br><br>
                        I did plan to expand the idea more but abandoned this project eventually to work with Unity. 
                        Although this project was short lived I did accomplish a camera system, text window system, and a way to write to console without flicker. 
                        These systems were the most challenging aspects of the project but also the parts I am proudest of.

                        This pack was my first project in Unity and the basis to my other Unity projects. 
                        It was the first area of game making I decided to focus on since player controllers are so important and I decided to release it on the Unity asset store 
                        since I found it so useful and figured other people could use it for their projects as well. 
                        Keeping this in mind I made it as customizable as I could and even went through many iterations of architecture as it grew before landing on the state based system it is now.<br><br>
                        This project overall has been one of my most challenging ones due to its complexity and the many situations I designed it for. 
                        This is due to me over designing it, giving in to feature creep, and trying to account for too many situations other people may want out of the package. 
                        This has led to it being a very useful pack for myself and led to me learning a lot of tricks and ways of handling character movement situations such as acceleration and slope handling for physics.

                My passion for creation and games has led me to become a programmer. 
                Programming provides challenges I enjoy overcoming and a way for me to create new things. 
                I use this to drive myself and learn new programming languages and new ways to make things, building on previous 
                knowledge I have obtained over the years, looking for my next project.<br><br>

                I first started down this road in high school (2015) I entered a game design class where I used Unreal Engine&#39s blueprint system to 
                discover a new hobby and creative outlet, making game prototypes. This led me to become a programmer, despite the fact that actual code intimidated me at the time.<br><br>

                After high school I went to the Academy of Art University to learn video game programming (2017-2019) where I learned C++ and programming principles such as object oriented programming and algorithms. 
                In my spare time I still used Unreal Engine for fun.<br><br>

                I transferred to Southern New Hampshire University (2020-present), when Covid hit, where I am now earning my Computer Science degree and learning Java, Python, and C++. 
                During my transfer I also switched to using Unity and C# to create game project ideas I have had as I found the engine created lighter weight game files more suited to my needs.<br><br>

                I have also recently (2023) picked up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to begin learning web development which has allowed me to create this page myself allong with other web projects found in my github repos.<br><br>
