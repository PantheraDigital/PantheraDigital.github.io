                My passion for creation and games has led me to become a programmer. 
                Programming provides challenges I enjoy overcoming and a way for me to create new things. 
                I use this to drive myself and learn new programming languages and new ways to make things, building on previous 
                knowledge I have obtained over the years, looking for my next project.<br><br>

                I first started down this road in high school (2015) I entered a game design class where I used Unreal Engineâ€™s blueprint system to 
                discover a new hobby and creative outlet, making game prototypes. This led me to become a programmer, despite the fact that actual code intimidated me at the time.<br><br>

                After high school I went to the Academy of Art University to learn video game programming (2017-2019) where I learned C++ and programming principles such as object oriented programming and algorithms. 
                In my spare time I still used Unreal Engine for fun.<br><br>

                I transferred to Southern New Hampshire University (2020-present), when Covid hit, where I am now earning my Computer Science degree and learning Java, Python, and C++. 
                During my transfer I also switched to using Unity and C# to create game project ideas I have had as I found the engine created lighter weight game files more suited to my needs.<br><br>

                I have also recently (2023) picked up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to begin learning web development which has allowed me to create this page myself allong with other web projects found in my github repos.<br><br>
